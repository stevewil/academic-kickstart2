Steven C. Williams is an academic technologist at the Dominguez Hills campus of the California State University system where he administers and runs the campus learning management system. His position allows him to facilitate the integration of teaching and learning technologies with faculty, staff and students. His academic background combined with his autodidactic interests in the computational arts (i.e, he's a longtime self-taught hacker with server, coding and database experience) has allowed him to develop a unique skillset among colleagues both inside and outside academia.
